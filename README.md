- [Listen to the piano roll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BX9MCyO6smk) (audio produced by Artis Wodehouse)
- [Old cover of the transcription](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgJ3PmMrurA) (inexact, played from memory after losing the score).

The music is in the public domain (published in 1926) and so is the transcription. Enjoy!
